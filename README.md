## Installation

- Before installing, you need to have `python3` installed, with a
  working `venv` module.
  - On Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS, this means installing the `python3-venv` package.
  - Supported Python 3 versions: >= 3.9
- Install this plugin through SignalK / npm.
- Use the native Victron app to obtain advertisement keys for
  communicating with your Victron devices.
  There are instructions for this
  [here](https://github.com/keshavdv/victron-ble#usage).
- Configure each Victron device in the SignalK plugin settings:
  - Decide on a SignalK ID for the battery/device/bus, e.g. `house`.
  - Provide the Bluetooth MAC address of the device.
  - Provide the advertisement key for the device.
  - If appropriate, provide a `secondary battery` ID. e.g. `start` for
    a BMV that is connected to a house bank and start bank.
- Restart SignalK.

## Development

- clone the plugin from Github
- `npm link` in the plugin directory
- `npm link signalk-victron-ble` in your server directory
